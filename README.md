Insect Specimen Microscope Sampling Dataset
we use vhx-7000 to collect data:
The VHX-7000: The VHX-7000 is Keyence's fifth-generation digital microscope system, capable of ultra-high-definition imaging. It is equipped with optical lenses ranging from 20× to 2000×, a high-speed autofocus module, a focus view camera, and an automatic coaxial stage. The system can achieve automatic and rapid focusing through focus view and the electric stage, providing a hardware foundation for high-quality imaging. The autofocus module plays a crucial role in the image acquisition process. In conventional microscopes, users need to manually move the tube to focus, which is inefficient and results in uneven imaging steps. In contrast, the autofocus module allows the lens to move and image at a specified step size, ensuring imaging efficiency and quality. The optical lenses ranging from 20× to 2000× enable the microscope system to observe specimens at different scales, including millimeter-sized biological tissue sections and centimeter-sized insects.
To ensure that the proposed image fusion algorithm is applicable to various types of microscopic specimens, we collected images using both thin biological tissue sections and thicker insect specimens. For each specimen, we first determined the extreme positions where the specimen contained clear areas at the top and bottom. Then, we imaged the specimen at a specified step size between these two extreme positions. The imaging step size was determined based on a combination of factors, including the type of specimen, the position of the specimen being observed, and the magnification of the lens. In each source image, the focused and defocused areas of the specimen are different.
In this study, we collected 74 sets of animal tissue section image sequences, including ciliated epithelial sections, axillary epidermal sections, fish ovary sections, and leech sections; 49 sets of plant tissue section image sequences, including lily bud sections, mint leaf mounts, dandelion fluff mounts, and pine stem cross-sections; and 320 sets of insect specimen image sequences, including beetles, flies, moths, bees, and maggots, covering both the overall appearance of insects and local details such as mouthparts, legs, and tails. Based on the VHX-7000 microscope imaging system, a total of 443 sets of microscopic image sequences were collected in this study, with each sequence comprising 2 to 15 multi-focus images and one fused image
